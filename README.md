An employee management app that can help you manage your employees.
You've got a problem, too many employees to handle, why not make an app? We did!
This app will allow you to manage your employees by add/updating and fire.... deleting them from the database.
This app will also display all tables in the database in a nice and tidy list for easy reading, sorted by ID.
Great!
It also prevent you from making any mistakes when updating and adding an employee
	and organize it in a nice way :)
Enjoy!

*** The data need to be imported into the database before adding employee since roleID is a primary key
	I will try to upload 123456 DB  !!!
